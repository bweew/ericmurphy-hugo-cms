    Lately, I've been posting songs since my Apple Music subscription is about
    to expire on July 6. To make it easier to post YouTube embeds, I created a
    tool.


    You might think it would be as easy as copying the embed code from YouTube into GitHub Pages, but GH Pages doesn't allow YouTube links. With Hugo, you can embed YouTube videos, but it's a hassle typing out Hugo shortcodes because you need the video ID.


    To solve this, I made a tool using JavaScript and regex, which I saved to my home screen on my phone. Even with Decap/Netlify CMS simplifying the Hugo blog posting experience, it still felt overly complicated.


    I'm pretty satisfied with the system I've put together (for now). I use Textastic and Working Copy for deep modifications to my base Hugo theme, while the actual writing of posts is easily done through the Netlify authentication login with a password and email, which is nice.


    The latest addition is an RSS icon that links to the feed. If you're on iOS, you can open it with NetNewsWire, an RSS reader I like. On Linux, you can open it with Newsboat.


    I've come to appreciate the CMS because it would be really annoying to dynamically add the footer link on every new page. Separating the code from the content really helps me stay focused, like a horse with blinders.
