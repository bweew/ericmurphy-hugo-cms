  text: Today I bought a new keyboard for 5$ at value village to replace my old
    one that got wrecked in the flood. Im pretty happy about it its a KB113 -
    Dell Black Keyboard KB113. they also had a logitech bluetooth one that ive
    seen go for 50bucks only missing the back battery plate. went to get
    batteries came back and went with this one on the off chance that its just
    completly broken also main reason I got this was because linux was giving me
    a hard time pairing things on my laptop so this is perfect!
