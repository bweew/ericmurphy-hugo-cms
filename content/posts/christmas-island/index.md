once upon a time saw a video with hundreds of red crabs swarming this island and it took me down many a wikipedia rabbit hole [chrismas island](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/the-history-listen/the-history-listen-coolies-christmas-island/14088942?utm_campaign=abc_listen&utm_content=link&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_source=abc_listen)

also reminds me, once saw big centipede devour a mouse while in the hall of the mountain king played in the background, the centipedes name was "father christmas". checked and it was removed probably because it was super gorey. the memory still gives me the heebie jeebies.
