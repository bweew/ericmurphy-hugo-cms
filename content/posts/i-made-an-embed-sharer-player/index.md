Paste video links (separated by new line) andit will create a page with all the videos embedded into it. Great for presentations or karaoke.

### Why would I want to do that?

Yeah I guess you could open multiple tabs and cycle between, but with this you can save and sharein 2 ways:

* save generated html as a webpage with included css
* send html as an email  



###### Import from text file.

Create a curated list of links as a .txt file and the generator can upload them and make a page from it.
