Paste in some video links on a new line and it creates the html webpage with embed codes for each video. Great for presentations or karaoke.

Why would I want to do that?

yeah you could just open multiple tabs and cycle between them but this lets you export in 2 ways.

* save generated html as a webpage with included css
* send it as an email 

but wait theres more!

you can also import the links from .txt files. Its good if your on a phone and you copy paste into a file you can save regularly as you go bc phones don't usually have a decent clipboard manager (I was thinking using local storage but I thought it would be better.
