Reminds me of cell phone addiction. Instead of the sun. the screen becomes their sun. blocking out the windows so it doesn't cause glare. When Flies are in your house buzzing around the lightbulbs its because they want to go outside and they think its the sun. People are on social media they want to be with their friends. They think their friends live inside their phone.
