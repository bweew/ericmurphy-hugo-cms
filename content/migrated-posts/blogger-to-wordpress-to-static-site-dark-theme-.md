I like this theme  
[dark elements](https://wordpress.org/themes/darkelements/)  
exporting my blogger blog as xml in the settings  
then use [blogger importer](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/blogger-importer/) to import it into wordpress  
tweak it a bit, then export the static site with [wp2static](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/blogger-importer/)  
the elementor plugin is great for quickly laying out a site.  
I like that I don't have to be stuck with wordpress this way.  
WP kind of makes me anxious from what I read about it being hacked all the time. WP tends to get slow really easily with plugins so this is a cool work around. of course theres HTTrack for cloning sites.

Ive been liking hugo with this CMS called [Quiqr](https://quiqr.org/) took a little tweaking but I managed to convert my site with the coder theme to work. Tried a few other themes but too much hassle figuring out front matter as its not standardized across themes. Some fields just didn't populate. docs only get you so far. Seemed really promising but hasn't seen any action since 2022.
