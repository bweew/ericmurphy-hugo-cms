[wordpress sqlite docker](https://github.com/andriesh/wordpress-sqlite)  
my first time using docker wow.  
struggling before to get the sqlite plugin to work in my xampp install of wordpress. kept fighting the permissions. by default everything is locked down heavy but that just lead me to heavy handedly chmodding all the permissions wide open to install themes (kind of gives me anxiety). The whole reason I was looking for sqlite was to run wordpress on my ipad.

Theres only a few php IDEs on ios. Draftcode ships with wordpress, phpmyadmin and sqlite. I went with webforge which has a more modern version of php.
