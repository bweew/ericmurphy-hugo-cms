[pinetools has a diff tool](https://pinetools.com/diff-compare-files) Really handy!!  
on my blog Ive added a script called hilightjs which adds syntax highlighting to codeblocks. ITS GREAT.  
Problem is on blogger html entities and other code gets stripped out on the input forms WHICH SUCKS.

I end up having this nice looking code but when I go to run it KEY IMPORTANT PARTS ARE MISSING. so just to double check that my code didn't get screwed up after posting it i like to run it into a diff tool which compares the input with the output. Vim has a diff tool but this website has a bunch of other great things. I first found out about it when I was looking for a color picker.
