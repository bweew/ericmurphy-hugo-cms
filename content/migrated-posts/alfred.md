I Installed Alfred on my mac
----------------------------

CMD SPACE

\-------------

annoyed how spotlight kept looking on the web for stuff instead of locally.

shift tab to finder + CMD F

\-------------

ehhh that works but i miss rofi on linux.

\- saw ali abdaal mention it helps keep his fingers on the keys.

decided to see what all the fuss was about finally.

\- installing another app to do something that should already just work sucks but I was in an experimental try new things type of mood.

IM LIKIN IT SO FAR

ALT SPACE = brings up alfred

\--------------

had to enable permissions and index the file system then restart it to get it to work but im happy with it now
