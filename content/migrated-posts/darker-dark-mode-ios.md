recently discovered these setings under accessibility:

*   display and text size

1.  reduce white point
2.  color filters on

*   grayscale

easy on the brain  
enjoy!

of course if you scroll further down there’s color tint if you want some redshift blur light blocker effect. that’s not my jam. makes me feel like i’m one of those roast ducks in the Chinese bbq. red used to be my favourite color. well i do still like it but for a phone screen no way. gray is the best. i feel like i’m watching tv in the 1950s or my phone is in metal band.
