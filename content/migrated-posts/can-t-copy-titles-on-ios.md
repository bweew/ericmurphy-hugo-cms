yoink clipboard manager is kind of useless. I use safari reading list or make a note in textastic or notes or beorg. although having another place to dump is kind of handy sometimes, for the most part it’s tedious. on ios 14 the links don’t auto grab and the keyboard gets in the way a lot. can’t hold a candle to clip tools. \*\*\* what i found works: copy links from netnewswire to notes and then copy again will give me plain text. for some reason the titles only show in messages, email and notes but not in any text editors.
