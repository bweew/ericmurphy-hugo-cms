seeing those posters in music shops with the fretboard layed out with dots to guide your fingers to play all the scales.  
too lazy to plug in my midi keyboard.  
actually no, i prefer this mechanical keyboard  
it feels so nice.  
inspired by watching accordion players play cajun music.  
shredding with those buttons.

in c youve got 3 octaves to play with in c  
you want that range in the other keys? too bad..  
naw actually its not a big deal just transpose that midi clip around. (if you cant make music with 3 octave range thats a you problem )  
remember those shitty plastic flutes from grade 4?  
I remember thinking they were stupid because they were monophonic and had 1 octave range.  
but when you see somebody throw down on a flute it makes you think twice.

also inspired by these guys...
