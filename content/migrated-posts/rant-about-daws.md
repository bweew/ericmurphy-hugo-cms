ranting about daws
==================

Fl studios piano roll is the best. its all you need its perfect. just stop here.

reason
======

its uneccesarily complex it looks impressive and in the right hands can create great results. The midi recording worked better than fl though and you could do audio tracking. I got a lot of great use out of it but it pissed me off motivated me to look for alternatives, in that way im greatful Ive learned a lot. I still use it though begrudgingly. Ive got strong opinions about it but I also realize its stupid. I should focus more on making good music instead of nitpicking on the software but theres just some things that bug me to no end.

Im pretty sure going this deep into daws is a mental illness where the cure is to just go offline and touch grass but since im already here il continue because I kind of just want to get it out. all of the software is good in good hands and its just my opinion its not worth getting worked up about. its definately not worth stressing over.

reaper is amazing
=================

*   you can edit video in it
*   superior to protools
*   too customizable its dangerous

ios trackers compared
=====================

tracker

sunvox

vividtracker

deflemask

squarebeat

pros

good shortcuts, has midi out, great tool for making chords

usable touch navigation, nice lofi grit

fm synthesis is really good.

touch interface, auv3 support

cons

built in insts suck, no auv3 support, wish patterns locked to a grid and sucks when you drag them and they get misaligned

1 octave range, menu divey, cant deal with xm insts hi-fi sounds. importing sounds is a huge hassle,

not keyboardy enough, ui is horrible

no keyboard support, cant easily do chords

Trackers on a computer
======================

Tracker

Milkytracker

Renoise

fasttracker 2

schism tracker

pros

runs on everything

supports sfz, can run on raspberry pi! can customize keyboard shortcuts.

runs on dos, can switch sounds with numpad, classic key commands, beautiful ui

can run on raspberry pi zero, lovely 100% keyboard based flow is a joy. secret fm synth

cons

no vsts (whatever its really good still) can't remap key shortcuts, probably have to reconfigure your system shortcuts to get the most out of it. on mac no insert key on mac (alt bkspce on new version ) cmd left right clash with linux/ mac spaces

although theres a piano roll plugin your better off just learning to track because its nothing like FLs piano roll super glitchy(maybe its gotten better idk been a while)

doesnt run so great on raspi 3b unless in dosbian. retropie its small idk how to fix that

sounds kind of lofi but the same files can be opened in milkytracker and sound fine? you can chop samples it it but its rocket science i always forget how/ its easier to just use reaper (no need to be a historial reenacter)
