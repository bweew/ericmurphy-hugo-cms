safari is cool because when your share from reading list to notes it captures the title with a thumbnail. if you share again from notes to mail you can get it out with the links. if you share anywhere else like textastic for example, you just get the url because its plain text!!! PLAIN TEXT that was the the problem. Well you can open up text edit and cmd shift T to make it RITCH TEXT and if you dont have any pictures you can save it as a html file!!! another thing that I thought was kind of neat was you can conver the ritch text in an email to a pdf althought it sucks because you have the to and from stuff in the header â€¦ its just not a clean look.

  

Its really nice not having to go to some sketchy website to convert RTF to HTML.or try to figure out some python script, or use pandoc, or mess around with clipboard managers.

  

This whole time what I was trying to do was so simple.

I just wanted to copy links and paste them somewhere else without having to go back and get the titles.

ive tried using beautiful soup to scrape the links or using regex, storing it as json/csv then templating a site with python jinja2 flask. over complicating it when it was just so simple

this whole time i could've just used RTF
