Icloud files on mac are stored in /library/mobile/ but its cool you can make a shortcut to cd into the beorg directory on Icloud. it makes it easier to keep everything in sync. im using syncthing for syncing between raspberry pi and linux mint. that way all the org files stay up to date. mobius on ios to sync has an IAP for linking outside the sandboxed app storage to external folders. its cool but I couldn't get it to work on my other ios devices. its a little annoying having to sync everything to that one, but its a heck of a lot easier than trying to get everything to work with syncthing.
